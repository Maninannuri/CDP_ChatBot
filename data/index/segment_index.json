which\ncan send data into Segment. It’s where your data originates. Add a source to\ncollect data to understand who your customers are and how they’re using your\nproduct. Create a source for each website or app you want to track. While it’s\nnot required that you have a single source for each server, site, or app, you\nshould create a source for each unique source of data.\n\nEach source you create has a write key, which is used to send data to that\nsource. For example, to load [`analytics.js`, the Segment JavaScript\nlibrary](https://segment.com/docs/connections/sources/catalog/libraries/website/javascript/)\non your page, the snippet on the [Quickstart\nGuide](https://segment.com/docs/connections/sources/catalog/libraries/website/javascript/quickstart/)\nincludes:\n\n    \n    \n    analytics.identify('user_123', {\n      email: 'jane.kim@example.com',\n      name: 'Jane Kim'\n      });\n    \n\n![](/docs/images/duplicate.svg)\n\nIf you don't see the source you're looking for in our catalog\n\nIf a tool is not listed as a supported source in Segment’s\n[catalog](https://segment.com/catalog/), then it is not possible to\nincorporate the integration out-of-the-box within a Segment workspace.\nHowever, as an alternative, you can use the [HTTP\nAPI](/docs/connections/sources/catalog/libraries/server/http-api/) source to\ncollect data from the tool’s API. You can also use\n[Functions](/docs/connections/functions/) to send or receive data from other\ntools.\n\n## Types of sources\n\nSegment has three types of sources:\n\n  * [Event streams](/docs/connections/sources/#event-streams-sources)\n  * [Cloud app sources](/docs/connections/sources/#cloud-app-sources)\n  * [Reverse ETL](/docs/connections/sources/#reverse-etl-sources)\n\n## Event streams sources\n\nEvent streams sources collect data from your website or app to monitor user\nactions. These sources include [website\nlibraries](/docs/connections/sources/#website-libraries),\n[mobile](/docs/connections/sources/#mobile), and [server\nsources](/docs/connections/sources/#server).\n\n### Source Overview\n\nThe Source Overview page for an event stream source shows you a [pipeline\nview](/docs/connections/sources/#pipeline-view) of all events Segment receives\nfrom your source, events that failed on ingest, events that are filtered at\nthe source level, and “eligible events”, which are the events that will flow\ninto your destinations. If you select one of the steps in the pipeline view,\nyou can see a line chart that reflects the fluctuations in volume alongside a\n[breakdown table](/docs/connections/sources/#breakdown-table) that has more\ndetails about the events impacted by the selected step.\n\n#### Pipeline view\n\nThe pipeline view shows each of the four steps Segment encounters when\nprocessing data from your source:\n\n  * **Events successfully received** : All events that Segment received from your source.\n  * **Failed on ingest** : Events that failed at the Tracking API level. For more information about errors that might cause events to fail on ingest, see Delivery Overview’s [Troubleshooting](/docs/connections/delivery-overview/#troubleshooting) documentation.\n  * **Filtered at source** : Events that were filtered out by source schema controls, Tracking Plans, or a common JSON schema.\n  * **Eligible events** : Eligible events are the events that flow downstream to your Segment destinations. This value is read-only, but you can see the events that flow downstream to a particular destination using [Delivery Overview](/docs/connections/delivery-overview).\n\nYou can use the time picker located on the Source Overview page to specify a\ntime period (last 10 minutes, 1 hour, 24 hours, 7 days, 2 weeks, or a custom\ndate range over the last two weeks) for which you’d like to see data. Segment\nsets the time picker to show data for the last 24 hours by default.\n\n![A screenshot of the Source Overview page for an Go source, with the Failed\non ingest step selected.](images/source-overview.png)\n\n#### Breakdown table\n\nThe breakdown table displays three tabs, **Event type** , **Event name** , and\n**App version**.\n\n  * **Event type** : The Segment Spec event type (Track call vs. Identify call, for example). _This tab also contains a “% change” metric, which displays how the event counts differ from the last comparable time range, represented as a percentage._\n  * **Event name** : The event name, provided by you or the source.\n  * **App version** : The app/release version, provided by you or the source.\n\nEach of these tabs displays an event count, which is the total number of\nevents that Segment received in a particular step.\n\nThe Unnamed or batched events under the **Event Name** tab is a collection of\nall identify and page/screen calls in the source.\n\n### Website libraries\n\n[Analytics.js](/docs/connections/sources/catalog/libraries/website/javascript/),\nthe JavaScript library, is the most powerful way to track customer data from\nyour website. If you’re just starting out, Segment recommends it over server-\nside libraries as the simplest installation for any website.\n\n[\n\n#####  The Analytics Quickstart Guide\n\nAnalytics and data collection is a very broad topic and it can be quite\noverwhelming. How do you get started?\n\n](https://segment.com/academy/intro/)\n\n### Mobile\n\nSegment’s Mobile SDKs are the best way to simplify your iOS, Android, and\nXamarin app tracking. Try them over server-side sources as the default\ninstallation for any mobile app.\n\n  * [AMP](/docs/connections/sources/catalog/libraries/mobile/amp)\n  * [Android](/docs/connections/sources/catalog/libraries/mobile/android)\n  * [Android Wear](/docs/connections/sources/catalog/libraries/mobile/android/wear)\n  * [iOS](/docs/connections/sources/catalog/libraries/mobile/ios)\n  * [Kotlin](/docs/connections/sources/catalog/libraries/mobile/kotlin-android/)\n  * [React Native](/docs/connections/sources/catalog/libraries/mobile/react-native)\n  * [Swift](/docs/connections/sources/catalog/libraries/mobile/swift/)\n  * [Xamarin](/docs/connections/sources/catalog/libraries/mobile/xamarin)\n\nAnalytics-Flutter library\n\nThe Analytics-Flutter library is currently only available in pilot phase and\nis governed by Segment’s [First Access and Beta Preview\nTerms](https://www.twilio.com/en-us/legal/tos). If you’d like to try out this\nlibrary, access the [Analytics-Flutter GitHub\nrepository](https://github.com/segmentio/analytics_flutter).\n\n### Server\n\nSegment’s server-side sources let you send analytics data directly from your\nservers. Segment recommends tracking from your servers when device-mode\ntracking (tracking on the client) doesn’t work. Check out the [guide on\nserver-side tracking](/docs/guides/how-to-guides/collect-on-client-or-server/)\nif you’re not sure whether it makes sense for your use case.\n\n  * [Clojure](/docs/connections/sources/catalog/libraries/server/clojure/)\n  * [Go](/docs/connections/sources/catalog/libraries/server/go/)\n  * [Java](/docs/connections/sources/catalog/libraries/server/java/)\n  * [Node.js](/docs/connections/sources/catalog/libraries/server/node/)\n  * [PHP](/docs/connections/sources/catalog/libraries/server/php/)\n  * [Python](/docs/connections/sources/catalog/libraries/server/python/)\n  * [Ruby](/docs/connections/sources/catalog/libraries/server/ruby/)\n  * [.NET](/docs/connections/sources/catalog/libraries/server/net/)\n\nCloud-mode tracking\n\nServer-side data management is when tag sends data to the Segment servers,\nwhich then passes that data to the destination system.\n\n## Cloud app sources\n\nCloud app sources empower you to pull together data from all of your different\nthird-party tools into a Segment warehouse or to your other enabled integrated\ntools. They send data about your users from your connected web apps. There are\ntwo types of Cloud Apps: [Object cloud\nsources](/docs/connections/sources/#object-cloud-sources) and [Event cloud\nsources](/docs/connections/sources/#event-cloud-sources).\n\n[\n\n#####  Comparing Cloud Sources\n\nWondering which cloud-apps send which types of data? Check out the Cloud\nSources comparison.\n\n](/docs/connections/sources/sources-compare/)\n\n### Object Cloud Sources\n\nThese Cloud App Sources can export data from its third party tool and import\nit directly into your Segment warehouse. Make sure you have a Segment\nwarehouse enabled before you enable any of the following sources:\n\n  * [Facebook Ads](/docs/connections/sources/catalog/cloud-apps/facebook-ads)\n\n  * [Google

Tracking\nAPI](/docs/connections/sources/catalog/libraries/server/http/). All of\nSegment’s other sources and platforms use the HTTP API to work their magic\nbehind the scenes.\n\n### Pixel\n\nSegment’s [Pixel Tracking\nAPI](/docs/connections/sources/catalog/libraries/server/pixel-tracking-api/)\nlets you track events from environments where you can’t execute code, like\ntracking email opens.\n\nEvent name | Description  \n---|---  \nEmail Delivered | The message has been successfully delivered to the receiving\nserver.  \nEmail Opened | The recipient has opened the HTML message. You need to enable\nOpen Tracking for getting this type of event.  \nEmail Link Clicked | The recipient clicked on a link within the message. You\nneed to enable Click Tracking for getting this type of event.  \nEmail Bounced | The receiving server could not or would not accept message.  \nEmail Marked as Spam | The recipient marked message as spam.  \nUnsubscribe | The recipient clicked on message’s subscription management link.  \n  \n## Reverse ETL sources\n\nReverse ETL sources are data warehouses that enable you to use [Reverse\nETL](/docs/connections/reverse-etl) to send data from your warehouse source to\nyour destinations.\n\nReverse ETL supports these sources:\n\n  * [BigQuery](/docs/connections/reverse-etl/reverse-etl-source-setup-guides/bigquery-setup/)\n  * [Databricks](/docs/connections/reverse-etl/reverse-etl-source-setup-guides/databricks-setup/)\n  * [Postgres](/docs/connections/reverse-etl/reverse-etl-source-setup-guides/postgres-setup/)\n  * [Redshift](/docs/connections/reverse-etl/reverse-etl-source-setup-guides/redshift-setup/)\n  * [Snowflake](/docs/connections/reverse-etl/reverse-etl-source-setup-guides/snowflake-setup/)\n\nSegment is actively working on adding more sources. If you’d like to request\nSegment to add a particular source, please note it on the [feedback\nform](https://airtable.com/shriQgvkRpBCDN955).\n\n## Create a source\n\nTo create a source:\n\n  1. Navigate to **Connections** and click **Add Source**.\n  2. Click the Source you’d like to add. _Note:_ More than 80% of workspaces start by adding their JavaScript website.\n  3. Click **Add Source**.\n  4. Enter a name for your source as well as any information on the setup page.\n  5. Click **Add Source**.\n\nOnce you’ve created a source, the source is automatically enabled and can\nimmediately receive events. You can review your new events in that source’s\n[Debugger](/docs/connections/sources/debugger/) tab.\n\nSources not connected to an enabled destination are disabled after 14 days\n\nIf your source is not connected to any destinations or is only connected to\ndisabled destinations, Segment automatically disables this source after 14\ndays, even if the source is receiving events. Disabled sources will no longer\nreceive data. You can view when Segment disables your destination in your\nworkspace’s [Audit Trail](https://app.segment.com/goto-my-workspace/audit-\ntrail) as `Event : Source Disabled` with `Actor : Segment`. Workspace members\nreceive an email notification before Segment disables your source so that your\nteam has time to take action. If you would like to prevent this behavior in\nyour workspace, fill out [this Airtable\nform](https://airtable.com/appADTobzkv0FYLbi/shr7V9LFDZh31cYWW).\n\nOne source or multiple sources?\n\nSegment suggests that you create one source for each type of data you want to\ncollect. For example, you might have one source for all of your website\ntracking and a different source for any mobile tracking. Creating one source\nper data type provides the following benefits:\n\n  * Debugger ease of use - mixing libraries/sources on a single API key means you’re heavily reliant on filtering to actually test events\n  * Flexibility sending data to different projects - if you want to have different warehouse schemas, analytics projects, etc, having multiple sources would create this separation\n  * More control - as your account grows with the number of destinations you enable, having separate sources allows you to have more control\n  * A source type cannot be changed after it is created. You must create a new source if you would like to use a different source type.\n\n## Library tiers\n\nSegment has defined three tiers for libraries: Flagship, Maintenance, and\nCommunity. These tiers indicate the level of support, enhancements, and\nmaintenance each library receives from Segment.\n\nThe criteria for assigning a library to a tier include its overall usage by\ncustomers and the availability of newer versions. Here’s how Segment defines\neach tier:\n\n  * **Flagship** libraries offer the most up-to-date functionality on Segment’s most popular platforms. Segment actively maintains Flagship libraries, which benefit from new feature releases and ongoing development and support.\n  * **Maintenance** libraries send data as intended but receive no new feature support and only critical maintenance updates from Segment. When possible, Segment recommends using a Flagship version of these libraries.\n  * **Community** libraries are neither managed nor updated by Segment. These libraries are available on GitHub under the MIT License for the open-source community to fork or contribute.\n\nIf a library falls into one of these tiers, you’ll see the tier label at the\nbeginning of the library’s page.\n\nThis page was last modified: 18 Nov 2024\n\n* * *\n\n## Further reading\n\n[\n\n#####  Sources Catalog\n\nA list of the available sources on the Segment platform.\n\n](/docs/connections/sources/catalog/)\n\n* * *\n\n### Need support?\n\nQuestions?

Adding Destinations allow you to act on your data and learn more about\nyour customers in real time.\n\nDestinations Catalog\n\nIf you want to explore the destinations compatible with Segment, check out the\n[Destinations catalog](/docs/connections/destinations/catalog/). Select an\nitem from the catalog to learn more about it. The documentation for each\ndestination explains how the Segment Tracking API methods are implemented for\nthat destination.\n\n## Sources vs Destinations\n\nSegment has [Sources](/docs/connections/sources/) and\n[Destinations](/docs/connections/destinations/). Sources send data _into_\nSegment, while Destinations receive data _from_ Segment.\n\n## Destination connection types\n\nSegment has three destination connection types:\n\n  * [Event streams](/docs/connections/destinations/#event-streams-destinations)\n  * [Storage](/docs/connections/destinations/#storage-destinations)\n  * [Reverse ETL](/docs/connections/destinations/#reverse-etl-destinations)\n\n### Event streams destinations\n\nEvent streams destinations are all destinations that aren’t storage or Reverse\nETL destinations. Adding these destinations allow you to act on your data and\nlearn more about your customers in real time. These include [Destination\nActions](/docs/connections/destinations/actions/).\n\n### Storage destinations\n\nStorage destinations enable you to store your raw Segment data. This enables\ndata analysts and data scientists to work with the raw data to derive deeper\nand more customized insights to support your organization. Learn more from the\n[storage overview page](/docs/connections/storage/).\n\n### Reverse ETL destinations\n\n[Reverse ETL](/docs/connections/reverse-etl) destinations are the business\ntools or apps you use that Segment syncs the data from your warehouse to.\n\nIf your destination is not listed in [the Reverse ETL\ncatalog](/docs/connections/reverse-etl/reverse-etl-catalog/), use the [Segment\nConnections destination](/docs/connections/destinations/catalog/actions-\nsegment/) to send data from your Reverse ETL warehouse to other destinations\nlisted in the [catalog](/docs/connections/destinations/catalog/). The Segment\nConnections destination enables you to mold data extracted from your warehouse\nin [Segment Spec](docs/connections/spec/) API calls that are then processed by\n[Segment’s HTTP Tracking\nAPI](/docs/connections/sources/catalog/libraries/server/http-api/). The\nSegment HTTP Tracking API lets you record analytics data. The requests hit\nSegment’s servers, and then Segment routes your data to any destination you\nwant. Get started with the [Segment Connections\ndestination](/docs/connections/destinations/catalog/actions-segment/).\n\n## Method compatibility\n\nNot all destinations can accept data from specific method types. To know if a\ndestination can accept data from specific method types, look for the _Quick\nInfo_ box at the top of the destination’s documentation page, or check out the\n[Destinations Methods comparison\nchart](/docs/connections/destinations/methods-compare/).\n\n## Source compatibility\n\nMany destinations can accept data from all types of sources, but some are only\ncompatible with specific source types (for example, web only, or server only).\nTo find out which source types a specific destination can accept data from,\ncheck the documentation for that destination in the _Quick info_ box, or in\nthe _Supported Sources and Connection Modes_ section.\n\n[\n\n#####  Destinations Compatibility Matrix\n\nWondering which destinations take which data? Check out the Destination\nconnection modes list by category.\n\n](/docs/connections/destinations/category-compare/)\n\n## Destination Actions\n\nIn June 2021, Segment released a new form of destinations called [Destinations\nActions](/docs/connections/destinations/actions/). These destinations allow\nusers to create _subscriptions_ : sets of conditions in which data is sent to\nthe destinations and data mappings, to format that data for the destination\ntool. Segment watches for data that matches the conditions you create (\n_triggers_ ) for the subscription, and when the conditions are met, uses an\nexplicit mapping to transform the incoming data to an output format that your\ndestination can use.\n\n## Connection modes\n\nSegment’s web source (Analytics.js), and native client-side libraries (iOS,\nAndroid, React-native) allow you to choose how you send data to Segment from\nyour website or app. There are two ways to send data:\n\n  * **Cloud-mode** : The sources send data directly to the Segment servers, which then translate it for each connected downstream destination, and send it on. Translation is done on the Segment servers, keeping your page size, method count, and load time small.\n\nHealthcare and Life Sciences (HLS) customers can encrypt data flowing into\ntheir destinations\n\nHLS customers with a HIPAA eligible workspace can encrypt data in fields\nmarked as Yellow in the Privacy Portal before they flow into an event stream,\ncloud-mode destination.  \nTo learn more about data encryption, see the [HIPAA Eligible Segment\ndocumentation](/docs/privacy/hipaa-eligible-segment/#data-encryption)\n\n  * **Device-mode** : You include additional code on your website or mobile app which allows Segment to use the data you collect on the device to make calls directly to the destination tool’s API, without sending it to the Segment servers _first_. (You still send your data to the Segment servers, but this occurs asynchronously.) This is also called _wrapping_ or _bundling_ , and it might be required when the source has to be loaded on the page to work, or loaded directly on the device to function correctly. When you use Analytics.js, you can change the device-mode destinations that a specific source sends from within the Segment web app, without touching any code.\n\nIf you use Server source libraries, they only send data directly to Segment in\nCloud-mode. Server library implementations operate in the server backend, and\ncan't load additional destination SDKs.\n\n### Choosing a connection mode\n\nCloud-mode destinations send data through Segment. Device-mode destinations\nsend data in parallel to Segment. There are tradeoffs between using cloud-mode\nand device-mode destinations. In general, Cloud-mode is preferred because you\nthen benefit from Segment’s system features, like retries, Replay, Warehouses,\nPrivacy blocking, filtering, and more.\n\nYou should consider using device-mode if you use destinations which record\ninformation directly on the user’s device. These types of tools might lose\nfunctionality if they aren’t loaded directly on the device.\n\nTake a look at the pros and cons chart of device-mode and cloud-mode\ndestinations to determine which connection mode is best for you:\n\nConnection Mode | Pros | Cons  \n---|---|---  \nCloud-mode | * Increased site or app performance  \n* Unaffected by ad blockers | * May limit Destination features  \nDevice-mode | * Access to all features of the Destination | * Decreased site\nor app performance  \n  \n#### Website source connection modes\n\nSegment’s website sources use device-mode by default, because so many website-\nbased destinations require that they be loaded on the page, and because size\nand page performance are less of a concern than on mobile. If your website\nsource only collects information that you can instrument yourself, then you\ncan use cloud-mode.\n\nFor example, a web-chat destination must be loaded to connect to the service\nand collect metrics efficiently - you don’t expect it to route chat messages\nthrough Segment! This _does_ mean that Segment might not receive a small\namount of the destination-specific information from your users. In the chat\nexample, if the destination is calculating idle time between messages, that\ndata would appear in the destination’s tooling, but not necessarily in the\nSegment data.\n\n#### Mobile source connection modes\n\nBy default, destinations configured on a mobile source send their data\ndirectly to the Segment servers, then translate it and use Cloud-mode to\nforward it to destinations. _Cloud-mode_ means that Segment sends the data\ndirectly from the Segment servers, to their servers. This means you don’t need\nto package third-party SDKs for destinations that can accept cloud-mode data.\nSome primarily web-based destinations also allow cloud-mode, which can help\nreduce app size, and improve load time and performance. You can read more\nabout the [effects of mobile app size on downloads in Segment’s\nblog](https://segment.com/blog/mobile-app-size-effect-on-downloads/).\n\nBefore you turn on or opt-in for cloud-mode for a mobile source, consider if\nyour destinations have features that require interactions on the device or\nrequire device-specific data (see the examples above). For example, if you use\ncloud-mode for Mixpanel, you’ll get your data on reporting and people, but\nwon’t be able to use their features for in-app surveys or auto-tracking. These\ncan be really valuable, but might not be a priority for your team.\n\n### How Segment determines Device-mode and Cloud-mode destinations\n\nThere are two main things Segment considers when deciding to use Device-mode\nor Cloud-mode, or both, for a destination partner:\n\n  1. [Anonymous Attribution Methodology](/docs/connections/destinations/#anonymous-attribution-methodology)\n  2. [Client-native Destination Features](/docs/connections/destinations/#client-native-destination-features)\n\n#### Anonymous attribution methodology\n\n##### Mobile attribution\n\nThe anonymous identifiers used on mobile devices are usually static, which\nmeans Segment doesn’t need to do additional resolution, and can build Cloud-\nmode destinations by default. Because Segment uses native advertising\nidentifiers on mobile devices, you don’t need a full SDK on the device to\nreconcile or identify a user. For example, you might track users who viewed an\nadvertisement in one app and installed another app as a result.\n\nHowever, some mobile attribution tools do more advanced reconciliation based\non more than the native identifier, which requires the SDK on the device to\nwork properly. For those destinations, Segment offers device-mode, which\npackages the tool’s SDK with the client-side library so that you can get the\nentire range of tool functionality.\n\n##### Web Attribution\n\nCross-domain identity resolution for websites requires that the attribution\ntool use a third-party cookie so it can track a user anonymously across\ndomains. This is a critical component of attribution modeling. As a matter of\nprinciple, Segment only uses first-party cookies and doesn’t share cookies\nwith partners, so Analytics.js and the data it collects aren’t enough to\ngenerate view-through attribution in ad networks.\n\nCustomers can load their libraries and pixels in the context of the browser\nand trigger requests to attribution providers from their device in response to\nSegment API calls to take advantage of advertising and attribution tools.\n\n#### Client-native destination features\n\nMany of Segment’s destinations offer client-side features beyond data\ncollection in their SDKs and libraries, for both mobile and web. In these\ncases, Segment offers Device-mode SDKs so that you can collect information on\nthe device using Segment, but still get the destination’s complete native\nfunctionality.\n\nSome features that usually require Device-mode include: automatic A/B testing,\ndisplaying user surveys, live chat or in-app notifications, touch and hover\nheatmapping, and accessing rich device data such as CPU usage, network data,\nor raised exceptions.\n\n### How can I tell which connection modes and platforms are supported for a\ndestination?\n\nThe first place to look is the individual destination documentation. Each one\nincludes a matrix of supported Sources and Connection Modes. Segment provides\na list of [all destinations and their connection\nmodes](/docs/connections/destinations/cmodes-compare/).\n\nIn order to override the default, check the destination settings pane in the\nSegment web App either for a **Connection Mode** toggle or instructions on\nbundling any additional mobile components required.\n\n## Sync modes\n\nSync modes allow users to define how changes in the source should send\ndownstream to your destination. Depending on which destinations you set up in\nSegment, you may need to choose a sync mode for your data. This configuration\ndetermines how Segment updates your destination based on the source data.\n\nThe available sync modes can vary based on the destination, integration type,\nand actions within the destination. For example, if you sync customer data,\nyou might have the option to Insert, Update, or Upsert records.\n\nAvailable sync modes include:\n\n  * **Update** : Modify existing records in the destination without adding new ones.\n  * **Upsert** : Update existing records and add new ones, if necessary.\n  * **Add** : Add records to a list, segment, or journey.\n  * **Remove** : Remove records from a list, audience, or journey.\n\n## Add a destination\n\nTo add a Destination:\n\n  1. Navigate to **Connections**.\n  2. Click **Add Destination**.\n  3. Choose the Destination you want to add and click **Configure**. Most users eventually add destinations for: Analytics, Advertising, Email Marketing and/or Live Chat.\n  4. Select the Source you want to connect to your Destination.\n  5. Click **Next**.\n  6. Give you Destination a name.\n  7. Click **Save**.\n  8. Configure the settings and enable your destination on the destination settings page.\n\n[Learn more](/docs/connections/destinations/add-destination/) about what\nadding a destination entails.\n\nDisabled destinations do not receive data\n\nIf you haven’t enabled your destination for the first time after you created\nit or if you actively disable a destination, Segment prevents any data from\nreaching the destination. Business Tier customers can request [a\nReplay](/docs/guides/what-is-replay/), which resends data from the time the\ndestination was disabled to the time it was re-enabled. Replays can also send\ndata to currently disabled destinations.\n\nSome destinations are not compatible with Replays after a certain period of\ntime, for example, 14 days. Check with Segment’s support team\n[friends@segment.com](mailto:friends@segment.com) to confirm that your\nintended destination allows historical timestamps.\n\n## Data deliverability\n\nSegment increases deliverability to destinations using\n[retries](/docs/connections/destinations/#retries) and\n[replays](/docs/guides/what-is-replay/). Retries happen automatically for all\ncustomers, while replays are available on request for [Business\nTier](https://segment.com/pricing/) customers.\n\nSegment’s data flow is primarily unidirectional, from Segment to integrated\ndestinations. Segment does not inherently support a bidirectional flow where\nevents, once delivered and processed by a destination, are sent back to\nSegment.\n\nSegment also uses [batching](/docs/connections/destinations/#batching) to\nincrease deliverability to your destinations. Some destinations have batching\nenabled by default, and some, like Segment’s [Webhook (Actions)\nDestination](/docs/connections/destinations/catalog/actions-webhook/), let you\nopt in to batching.\n\nSome cases of event batching might lead to observability loss\n\nWhile batching does increase event deliverability, you might experience error\namplification, as if the entire batch fails, all events will be marked with\nthe same status. For example, if a batch fails due to one `429` (Rate Limit)\nerror, it might appear in the UI that there was one 429s request failure for\neach item in the batch.\n\n### Retries\n\n#### Retries in Segment’s client libraries\n\nSegment’s client libraries ensure delivery of your data to the API reliably in\nthe face of spotty connections, device failure, or network partitions in your\ndata centers.\n\nWhen you use Segment’s mobile SDK, Segment dispatches each event to a\nbackground thread where the event is then written to a queue. Later, Segment’s\nSDK batches together many requests in to one compressed request and sends it\nto Segment’s servers. Segment’s SDKs minimize battery use and bandwidth use by\npowering up the radio less frequently and for shorter time periods.\n\nIf the delivery of the payload is not successfully sent due to connection\nissues, all of your SDKs will automatically retry the request until successful\nreceipt of the payload according to the following policies. Note that retry\npolicies are subject to change / tuning in the future.\n\nPlatform | **Initial Wait -** Sleep duration before the first retry | **Wait\nGrowth -** Rate of growth of the sleep duration between each retry | **Max\nWait -** Maximum sleep duration between retries | **Max Attempts -** Maximum\nnumber of individual retries  \n---|---|---|---|---  \nC++ | 1s | None | 1s | 5  \nClojure | 15s | Exponential | 1h | 50  \nGo | 100ms | Exponential | 10s | 10  \nJava | 15s | Exponential | 1h | 50  \nJavaScript | 1s | Exponential | 1h | 10  \n.Net | 100ms | Exponential | 6.4s | 7  \nNode.js | 100ms | Exponential | 400ms | 3  \nPHP | 100ms | Exponential | 6.4s | 7  \nPython | 1s | Exponential | 34m | 10  \nRuby | 100ms | Exponential | 10s | 10  \n  \n#### Mobile library retries\n\nAll mobile libraries handle retries by periodically attempting to flush their\ninternal queue of events to Segment. If the flush is unsuccessful, the library\nwaits until the next regularly-scheduled flush time to try again. The\nbackground queue of requests to Segment is bounded in size so if events are\nbeing queued faster than we can successfully flush them to Segment, some\nevents may be dropped.\n\n#### Retries between Segment and destinations\n\nThe destination endpoint APIs have fluctuations in availability due to a\nnumber of issues ranging from network failures to bugs to overload. Segment’s\ninternal systems retry failed destination API calls for four hours with a\nrandomized exponential backoff after each attempt. This substantially improves\ndelivery rates.\n\nHere’s an example destination that was only successfully accepting 93.36% of\nall API requests but was achieving a 99.28% final deliverability rate due to\nSegment’s retry functionality.\n\n![Segment destination data deliverability retries](images/integration-data-\ndeliverability.png)\n\nYou can see the current destination endpoint API success rates and final\ndelivery rates for Segment’s server-side destinations on Segment’s [status\npage](https://status.segment.com).\n\n### Replays\n\nReplay is available to [Business tier](https://segment.com/pricing) customers.\n[Contact Segment](https://segment.com/contact/sales) to learn more.\n\n[Replays](/docs/guides/what-is-replay/) allow customers to load historical\ndata from Segment’s S3 logs into downstream destinations which accept cloud-\nmode data. So, for example, if you wanted to try out a new email or analytics\ntool, Segment can replay your historical data into that tool. This gives you a\ngreat testing environment and prevents data lock-in when vendors try to hold\ndata hostage.\n\nIf you submitted [`suppress_only` requests](/docs/privacy/user-deletion-and-\nsuppression/#suppressed-users), Segment still retains historical events for\nthose users, which can be replayed. If you do not want historical events\nreplayed for suppressed users, submit `suppress_and_delete` requests instead.\n\n### Batching\n\nSegment uses [stream batching](/docs/connections/destinations/#stream-\nbatching) for all destinations that require near-realtime data and [bulk\nbatching](/docs/connections/destinations/#bulk-batching) for some data flows\nin our pipeline.\n\n#### Stream batching\n\nFor all destinations, except for non-realtime Engage syncs and Reverse ETL\nsyncs, Segment processes events from your source as they arrive and then flows\nthe data downstream to your destinations in small batches, in a process called\n**stream batching**. These batches might contain different events between\nretry attempts, as events in previous batches may have succeeded, failed with\na permanent error, or expired. This variability reduces the workload the\nsystem processes during partial successes, allows for better per-event\nhandling, and reduces the chance of load-related failures by using variable\nbatch formations.\n\n#### Bulk batching\n\nSome data flows may be able to use a process called **bulk batching** , which\nsupports batching for destinations that produce between several thousand and a\nmillion events at a time. Real-time workloads or using a Destination Insert\nFunction may prevent bulk batches from being formed. Batches contain the same\nevents between retries.\n\nThe following destinations support bulk batching:\n\n  * [DV360](/docs/connections/destinations/catalog/actions-display-video-360/)\n  * [Google Adwords Remarketing Lists](/docs/connections/destinations/catalog/adwords-remarketing-lists/)\n  * [Klaviyo (Actions)](/docs/connections/destinations/catalog/actions-klaviyo/)\n  * [Pinterest Audiences](/docs/connections/destinations/catalog/pinterest-audiences/)\n  * [Snapchat Audiences](/docs/connections/destinations/catalog/snapchat-audiences/)\n  * [LiveRamp](/docs/connections/destinations/catalog/actions-liveramp-audiences/)\n  * [The Trade Desk CRM](/docs/connections/destinations/catalog/actions-the-trade-desk-crm/)\n\nYou must manually configure bulk batches for Actions destinations\n\nTo support bulk batching for the Actions Webhook destination, you must set\n`enable-batching: true` and `batch_size: >= 1000`.\n\n## IP Allowlisting\n\nIP Allowlisting uses a NAT gateway to route traffic from Segment’s servers to\nyour destination through a limited range of IP addresses, which can prevent\nmalicious actors from establishing TCP and UDP connections with your\nintegrations.\n\nIP Allowlisting is available for customers on Business Tier plans.\n\n### Supported destinations\n\nSegment supports IP Allowlisting in [all\ndestinations](/docs/connections/destinations/catalog/) except for the\nfollowing:\n\n  * [LiveRamp](/docs/connections/destinations/catalog/actions-liveramp-audiences/)\n  * [TradeDesk](/docs/connections/destinations/catalog/actions-the-trade-desk-crm/)\n  * [Amazon Kinesis](/docs/connections/destinations/catalog/amazon-kinesis/)\n\nDestinations that are not supported receive traffic from randomly assigned IP\naddresses.\n\n### Configure IP Allowlisting\n\nTo enable IP Allowlisting for your workspace:\n\n  1. From your Segment workspace, navigate to **[Settings> Workspace settings > Destination IP settings](https://app.segment.com/goto-my-workspace/settings/destination-ip-settings)**.\n  2. On the Destination IP settings page, click **Enable IP allowlisting**.\n  3. The page displays the IP address ranges that Segment uses to route data from Segment’s internal systems to your destination. Note these ranges, as you’ll need this information to enforce IP restriction in your downstream destinations.\n  4. Open each of your downstream tools and configure IP restriction for each destination. For more information, refer to the documentation for your downstream tool.\n\n_IP restriction might not be supported in all destinations._\n\nThis page was last modified: 17 Jan 2025\n\n* * *\n\n### Need support?\n\nQuestions?

Warehouse?](/docs/guides/#whats-a-warehouse)\n\n* * *\n\nWelcome! This page is a high-level introduction to the Segment Platform,\nincluding what it does and how. (If you’re looking for detailed information\nabout architecture, setup, or maintenance, you can **[skip\nahead](/docs/guides/#where-can-i-learn-more).**)\n\n## What is Segment?\n\nSegment is a Customer Data Platform (CDP), which means that it provide a\nservice that simplifies collecting and using data from the users of your\ndigital properties (websites, apps, etc). With Segment, you can collect,\ntransform, send, and archive your [first-party customer\ndata](https://segment.com/books/customer-data/first-party-data/). Segment\nsimplifies the process of collecting data and hooking up new tools, allowing\nyou to spend more time using your data, and less time trying to collect it.\n\nYou can also enrich the customer data you collect by connecting data from your\nother tools, and then aggregate it to monitor performance, inform decision-\nmaking processes, and create uniquely customized user experiences. You can\nalso use Unify, Segment’s identity resolution tool, to unify data from\nindividual users to gain a wholistic understanding of their actions.\n\n[\n\n#####  Segment University: How Segment Works\n\nCheck out how to get started with Segment in Segment University! (Must be\nlogged in to access.)\n\n](https://university.segment.com/introduction-to-\nsegment/299955?reg=1&referrer=docs)\n\n## What does it do?\n\nIn its very simplest form, Segment generates messages about what’s happening\nin your site or app, then translates the content of those messages into\ndifferent formats for use by other tools (called\n‘[Destinations](/docs/connections/destinations)’), and transmits messages to\nthose tools. The Segment servers also archive a copy of the data, and can\n[send data to your storage systems](/docs/connections/storage/) (such as\ndatabases, warehouses, or bulk-storage buckets).\n\n## How does Segment work?\n\nSegment’s libraries generate and send messages to the tracking API in JSON\nformat. Segment provides a standard structure for the basic API calls, along\nwith a recommended JSON structure (also known as the ‘Spec’, a type of schema)\nthat helps keep the most important parts of your data consistent, while\nallowing great flexibility in what other information you collect and where.\n\n### Segment Messages\n\nWhen you implement Segment, you add the Segment code to your website, app, or\nserver, which generates messages based on specific triggers you define. At its\nvery simplest, this code can be a snippet that you copy and paste into the\nHTML of a website to track page views. It can also be as complex as Segment\ncalls embedded in a React mobile app to send messages when the app is opened\nor closed, when the user performs different actions, or when time based\nconditions are met (for example “ticket reservation expired” or “cart\nabandoned after 2 hours”).\n\nSegment has [Sources](/docs/connections/sources/) and\n[Destinations](/docs/connections/destinations/). Sources send messages _into_\nSegment (and other tools), while Destinations receive messages _from_ Segment.\n\n### Anatomy of a Segment message\n\nThe most basic Segment message requires only a `userID` or `anonymousID`; all\nother fields are optional to allow for maximum flexibility. However, a normal\nSegment message has three main parts: the [common\nfields](/docs/connections/spec/common/), the [“context”\nobject](/docs/connections/spec/common#context), and the properties (if it’s an\nevent) or traits (if it’s an object).\n\nThe common fields include information specific to how the call was generated,\nlike the timestamp and library name and version. The fields in the context\nobject are usually generated by the library, and include information about the\nenvironment in which the call was generated: page path, user agent, OS, locale\nsettings, etc. The properties and traits are optional and are where you\ncustomize the information you want to collect for your implementation.\n\nAnother common part of a Segment message is [the `integrations`\nobject](/docs/guides/filtering-data/#filtering-with-the-integrations-object),\nwhich you can use to explicitly filter which destinations the call is\nforwarded to. However this object is optional, and is often omitted in favor\nof non-code based filtering options.\n\n### Segment Sources\n\nSegment provides several types of Sources which you can use to collect your\ndata, and which you can choose among based on the needs of your app or site.\nFor websites, you can embed a library which loads on the page to create the\nSegment messages. If you have a mobile app, you can embed one of Segment’s\nMobile libraries, and if you’d like to create messages directly on a server\n(if you have, for example a dedicated .NET server that processes payments),\nthere are several server-based libraries that you can embed directly into your\nbackend code. (You can also use [cloud-\nsources](/docs/connections/sources/about-cloud-sources/) to import data about\nyour app or site from other tools like Zendesk or Salesforce, to enrich the\ndata sent through Segment.)\n\n### Destinations\n\nOnce Segment generates the messages, it can send them directly to the Segment\nservers for translation and forwarding on to the Destinations you’re using, or\nit can make calls directly from the app or site to the APIs of your\nDestination tools. Which of these methods you choose depends on which\nDestinations you’re using and other factors. You can read more about these\nconsiderations in our [Connection Modes\ndocumentation](/docs/connections/destinations/#connection-modes)\n\n## What happens next?\n\nMessages sent to the Segment servers using the tracking API can then be\ntranslated and forwarded on to Destination tools, inspected to make sure that\nthey’re in the correct format or schema, inspected to make sure they don’t\ncontain any Personally Identifying Information (PII), aggregated to illustrate\noverall performance or metrics, and archived for later analysis and reuse.\n\n## What are the other parts of the Segment platform?\n\nIn addition to [Connections](/docs/connections/) (our core message routing\nproduct) Segment offers additional features to help your organization do more\nwith its data, and keep data clean, consistent, and respectful of end-user\nprivacy. The following products are available:\n\n  * [Privacy Portal](/docs/privacy/portal/) \\- available to all users - Inspect incoming messages to identify PII, classify it by its riskiness, and decide how it’s handled and which tool may use it.\n  * [Protocols](/docs/protocols/) \\- create a unified schema for all the data you collect, coordinate implementation to keep it consistent with that schema, and make sure your data always arrives in the right format and block and alert when it doesn’t.\n  * [Engage](/docs/engage/) \\- identify groups of users (“audiences”) based on behavior or other metrics calculated from your data, and send these groups to Destinations, identity resolution\n\n## Where can I learn more?\n\n  * [ I’m a Segment Developer ](/docs/guides/intro-impl/)\n\n  * [ I’m a Segment Data user ](/docs/guides/intro-user/)\n\n  * [ I’m a Segment Workspace administrator ](/docs/guides/intro-admin/)\n\n## What’s a Workspace?\n\nA workspace is a group of sources that can be administered and billed\ntogether. Workspaces help companies manage access for multiple users and data\nsources. Workspaces let you collaborate with team members, add permissions,\nand share sources across your whole team using a shared billing account.\n\nWhen you first log in to your Segment account, you can create a new workspace,\nor choose to log into an existing workspace if your account is part of an\nexisting organization.\n\n## What’s a Source?\n\nIn Segment, you create a source (or more than one!) for each website or app\nyou want to track. We **highly recommend** creating a Source for each unique\nsource of data (each site, app, or server), though this isn’t required.\n\nSources belong to a workspace, and the URL for a source looks something like\nthis: `https://segment.com/<my-workspace>/sources/<my-source-name>/`\n\nYou can create new sources using the button in the workspace view. Each source\nyou create has a write key, which is used to send data to that source. For\nexample, to load [`analytics.js`, the Segment JavaScript\nlibrary](https://segment.com/docs/connections/sources/catalog/libraries/website/javascript/)\non your page, the snippet on the [Quickstart\nGuide](https://segment.com/docs/connections/sources/catalog/libraries/website/javascript/quickstart/)\nincludes:\n\n    \n    \n    analytics.load(\"YOUR_WRITE_KEY\");\n    \n\n![](/docs/images/duplicate.svg)\n\n## What’s a Destination?\n\nDestinations are business tools or apps that you can connect to the data\nflowing through Segment. Some of Segment’s most popular destinations are\nGoogle Analytics, Mixpanel, Kissmetrics, Customer.io, Intercom, and KeenIO.\n\nAll of these tools run on the same data: who are your customers and what are\nthey doing? But each tool requires that you send that data in a slightly\ndifferent format, which means that you’d have to write code to track all of\nthis information, again and again, for each tool, on each page of your app or\nwebsite.\n\nEnter Segment. Do it once.\n\nSegment eliminates this process by introducing an abstraction layer. You send\nyour data to Segment, and Segment understands how to translate it so we can\nsend it along to any destination. You enable destinations from the catalog in\nthe Segment App, and user data immediately starts flowing into those tools. No\nextra code required!\n\nSegment supports many categories of destinations, from advertising to\nmarketing, email to customer support, CRM to user testing, and even data\nwarehouses. You can view a complete list of available\n[destinations](/docs/connections/destinations/catalog/) or check out the\n[destination page](/docs/connections/destinations/) for a searchable list\nbroken down by category.\n\n## What’s a Warehouse?\n\nA warehouse is a central repository of data collected from one or more\nsources. This is what commonly comes to mind when you think about a relational\ndatabase: structured data that fits neatly into rows and columns.\n\nIn Segment, a Warehouse is a special type of destination. Instead of streaming\ndata to the destination all the time, we load data to them in bulk at regular\nintervals. When we load data, we insert and update events and objects, and\nautomatically adjust their schema to fit the data you’ve sent to Segment.\n\nThis page was last modified: 28 Mar 2023\n\n* * *\n\n### Need support?\n\nQuestions?
